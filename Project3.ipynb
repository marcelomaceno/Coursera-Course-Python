        "Marcos is a cooker that lives in the borough of Etobicoke and at the neighborhood of Cloverdale in Toronto. He comes from a family of famous cookers of Canada. He wants to build his first restaurant at Canada but he wants to build in a place that has the same characteristics as his neighborhood. He could build his first restaurant at this neighborhood, but he wants to know if there are other places with the same characteristics. He looked for a statistician to see if there are other places in Toronto with the same characteristics as his neighborhood. So, let's get the job done and find an answer for Marcos."
